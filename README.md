# A Job Scraper for Indeed

## Background
Going through job listings drives me a bit crazy, because most of what I'm trying to do could be sped up considerably if I wasn't dealing with a website's bare-bones UI.

I wanted to improve on this process by writing a program that could actually deliver me the kinds of results I want, in the format I want it:

1. A list of jobs with just the most basic information: title, company posting, and date posted
2. Jobs that have been pre-filtered by keyword: I'm not looking to work as a receptionist, so I'd rather not see _any_ listing with that in the title
3. A way to quickly sort through and rank the jobs that have been posted.

## Usage

### Requirements

The program is built in Python 3.9, and relies on the following external packages:

| Package | Usage |
| - | - |
| Urllib | Dynamically builds URLs |
| Selenium | Scrapes Indeed's website while bypassing CloudFlare's anti-bot protection |
| bs4 | BeautifulSoup: parses html files and retrieves text |
| pandas | Manages and filters lists of selected jobs |
| fuzzywuzzy | Applies fuzzy matching to job titles |
| pyperclip | Copies job links to clipboard after sorting |

You'll also need to have a ```jobs.txt``` file in the same folder as main.py: it's a text file with a list of search queries, separated by line. If your query is more than one word, separate it with spaces or a "+". Case doesn't matter. It should look something like the below:

```
Janitor
Head of Janitorial Services
Zamboni Driver
Bodyguard
secret agent
```

You may also want to edit the filters in a file called filters.txt, also in the same folder as main.py. These filters will remove jobs from consideration if they contain a word in the list. I have a few set for myself, but you should tailor this to your requirements. It should look something like the below:

```python
assistant
bartender
director
executive
```

The program automatically filters jobs based on fuzzy matching between the job title and query you set up in ```jobs.txt```, which should remove the vast majority of irrevalant results. You can fine-tune this filter in line 64 of [jobanalysis.py](https://github.com/sam-hatley/jobsearch/blob/master/jobanalysis.py#L64), which is currently set to 75(%) using fuzzywuzzy's `token_set_ratio()`.

### Files

This is made up of three files:

| File | Description |
| - | - |
| [main.py](main.py) | The file used to run the program. It calls functions within the other two files to allow a text-based user interface for fetching and sorting jobs. |
| [jobscrape.py](jobscrape.py) | Stores functions related to scraping Indeed |
| [jobanalysis.py](jobanalysis.py) | Stores functions related to handling the output of jobscrape.py |

### Running the Program

I would highly recommend running this behind a VPN: although I've done as much as I can to slow down the scraping process, Indeed isn't fond of scraping software and may block your IP if you use this frequently.

1. After installing any [dependencies](#requirements), run [main.py](main.py).
2. It will ask you if you want to scrape or load. If it's your first time running the program, choose scrape (s).
3. Choose a number of days to scrape jobs: if you select 1, it will search for jobs posted between yesterday and today. Type any number above 0.
4. The program will go through your list of jobs, and search each one until it hits the number of days you've specified. Don't worry if you get an error in the process: I haven't explicitly built in a way of handling "no results" pages, but the program will continue to work even if it hits one.
5. Go ahead and take a look at the results. Plug in a number to "rate" the job. If you're finished before going through the results, type "q".
6. You'll see a list with the job titles and links in the program: you can take a look through them here, or just go to the generated file ```selects_YYYY-MM-DD.csv``` to look through them later. Following a search, each link is also sent to the system clipboard: I'd recommend a browser add-on like ["Open Multiple URLs"](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-multiple-urls/) to go through the batch at once. All jobs and ratings are stored in ```joblist.pkl```, which you can export to csv at your leisure using the program.

Roughly, this is what the program looks like:

```
(S)crape new jobs, (L)oad old jobs, or (E)xport jobs?: s

Retrieving results 1-15 for Janitor
