# Here: build a program that iterates through scrape_jobs as required for the
# number of jobs and job titles to fetch

# Need to do something with the data output: thinking we build it into a dataframe, which
# keeps a record of jobs (by link?), and does not save jobs that have been seen before.

# If we can build some kind of interface to look through jobs, mark those that've been
# applied to, etc, that would be best. Total automation is possible, but will take quite
# a bit more work!
